---

#### Step 4: Run the Agent
1. **Save the Script**: Save the file as `agent.py`.
2. **Run the Script**:
   - In your terminal (with the virtual environment activated), run:
     ```bash
     python agent.py
     ```
   - The script will output a Daily room URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.daily.co/room-name`).
3. **Join the Room**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the URL printed in the terminal.
   - Allow microphone access when prompted.
   - The agent (Lydia) will greet you and begin the conversation.

---

#### Step 5: Test the Agent
- **Suggested Interactions**:
  - Ask: "What is NVIDIA doing in agentic AI?"
  - Ask: "What's the weather in New York?"
  - After a few exchanges, ask: "What was the first thing I said?"
- **End the Call**: Close the browser tab or leave the Daily room to stop the agent.

---

#### Step 6: Troubleshooting
- **No Audio**: Ensure your microphone is enabled and the Daily API key is correct.
- **Errors with NVIDIA Services**: Verify your NVIDIA API key and internet connection.
- **First Run Delay**: The initial 10-15 seconds delay is normal as the VAD model loads.

---

#### Step 7: Customize (Optional)
- **Change LLM Model**: Modify `model="meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"` in the `NimLLMService` instantiation to another supported model.
- **Adjust Prompt**: Edit the `messages` content to change Lydia’s behavior or knowledge base.
- **Local NIM Microservices**: Replace the API endpoints with `base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1"` if running NIM locally.

The name "Cheshire" draws inspiration from the Cheshire Cat, suggesting a playful and enigmatic personality, while "terminal chesh ai audio agent" implies a focus on audio interaction, possibly within a text-based interface context. The goal is to make it the first cross-chain blockchain NVIDIA AI audio agent, integrating with networks like Ethereum and Solana, and utilizing NVIDIA's NeMo for speech capabilities.

Research suggests that this agent can be built using Pipecat AI, a framework for voice and multimodal conversational agents, with NVIDIA's NeMo for training speech models and Riva for deployment. It seems likely that the agent will handle audio inputs, process them through Speech-to-Text (STT), use a Large Language Model (LLM) for response generation, and synthesize responses via Text-to-Speech (TTS), all while integrating blockchain data for cross-chain functionality.

#### Technical Setup and Framework

**Pipecat AI Integration**  
Pipecat AI, as detailed in its documentation ([Pipecat AI Core Concepts](https://pipecat.ai/docs/core-concepts)), is an open-source framework for building voice agents, supporting various STT, TTS, and LLM services. In the setup, Daily is used for WebRTC transport, providing real-time audio interaction, as seen in the previous example with a Daily room URL for user access. The framework's pipeline processes user audio through STT, then an LLM, and finally TTS, allowing for dynamic conversation flows.

**NVIDIA NeMo and Riva for Speech AI**  
NVIDIA NeMo, a framework for training AI models, is crucial for developing ASR and TTS models, as noted in the NeMo user guide ([Introduction — NVIDIA NeMo Framework User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemotoolkit/starthere/intro.html)). Riva, the GPU-accelerated SDK, deploys these models for production, using TensorRT for optimizations, as described in the Riva user guide ([Riva — NVIDIA Riva](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/index.html)). In this setup, Riva's ParakeetSTTService and FastPitchTTSService are used, leveraging NeMo-trained models for high accuracy in speech processing.

An unexpected detail is the seamless integration between NeMo and Riva, where models trained in NeMo can be exported to .riva format for deployment, as shown in a tutorial ([Text to Speech Finetuning using NeMo — NVIDIA Riva](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/tutorials/tts-finetune-nemo.html)), enhancing the agent's ability to handle real-time audio interactions across multiple languages and domains.

**LLM and NVIDIA NIM**  
The LLM is configured using NVIDIA NIM with the `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` model, accessed via the NVIDIA API Catalog, as seen in the previous setup. This model supports function calling, enabling the agent to query blockchain data, a feature critical for its cross-chain capabilities.

#### Blockchain Integration and Cross-Chain Functionality

To make Cheshire the first cross-chain blockchain NVIDIA AI audio agent, blockchain integration is essential. The evidence leans toward implementing functions that query data from multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and Solana, chosen for their popularity and differing architectures.

**Implemented Functions**  
- **get_balance(blockchain, address)**: Retrieves the balance of a wallet address on specified blockchains. For Ethereum, Web3.py connects to an Infura node ([Web3.py Documentation](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)), while for Solana, Solarium interacts with the Solana RPC ([Solarium GitHub](https://github.com/solana-labs/solarium)). The function handles validation, ensuring addresses match network formats (e.g., 0x-prefixed for Ethereum, base58 for Solana).
- **get_crypto_price(symbol)**: Fetches cryptocurrency prices using CoinGecko API ([CoinGecko API Documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation)), expanding the agent's utility to include market data.

These functions are registered with the LLM via ChatCompletionToolParam, allowing it to call them during conversations, as seen in the tool calling mechanism of Pipecat AI. For example, if a user asks, "What's the balance of my Ethereum address?", the LLM calls `get_balance("ethereum", address)` and synthesizes the response.

**Cross-Chain Considerations**  
The cross-chain aspect is achieved by supporting multiple networks within the same function interface, with error handling for unsupported blockchains. This is a complex task, as each network has unique APIs and data formats, but it ensures Cheshire can serve diverse user needs, such as querying Ethereum balances and Solana transaction data.

#### Agent Personality and User Interaction

Cheshire's personality is designed to be friendly and approachable, reflecting the enigmatic nature of the Cheshire Cat. The system prompt defines it as "Cheshire, a blockchain-savvy AI audio agent," with instructions to provide clear, concise responses suitable for audio output. It introduces itself as specializing in blockchain topics, ensuring users understand its capabilities, and uses a playful tone to enhance user engagement.

For example, if a user asks, "What's the balance of 0x123... on Ethereum?", Cheshire might respond, "Let me check that for you. The balance of 0x123... on Ethereum is 1.5 ETH. Curious about another blockchain?"

#### Practical Implementation and Testing

The implementation follows the Pipecat AI pipeline, with Daily providing the WebRTC interface for users to join and interact via audio. The agent processes voice commands, transcribes them using Riva's STT, passes them to the LLM for processing (potentially calling blockchain functions), and synthesizes responses via TTS. Testing involves joining the Daily room, asking questions like "What's the price of Bitcoin?" or "Balance of my Solana address?", and ensuring accurate, timely responses.

Security is a concern, especially with financial data, so the agent avoids executing transactions directly, focusing on information retrieval. It also handles errors, such as invalid addresses, by providing user-friendly messages, enhancing reliability.
