```

---

#### Step 4: Run the Agent
1. **Save the Script**: Save the file as `agent.py`.
2. **Run the Script**:
   - In your terminal (with the virtual environment activated), run:
     ```bash
     python agent.py
     ```
   - The script will output a Daily room URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.daily.co/room-name`).
3. **Join the Room**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the URL printed in the terminal.
   - Allow microphone access when prompted.
   - The agent (Lydia) will greet you and begin the conversation.

---

#### Step 5: Test the Agent
- **Suggested Interactions**:
  - Ask: "What is NVIDIA doing in agentic AI?"
  - Ask: "What's the weather in New York?"
  - After a few exchanges, ask: "What was the first thing I said?"
- **End the Call**: Close the browser tab or leave the Daily room to stop the agent.

---

#### Step 6: Troubleshooting
- **No Audio**: Ensure your microphone is enabled and the Daily API key is correct.
- **Errors with NVIDIA Services**: Verify your NVIDIA API key and internet connection.
- **First Run Delay**: The initial 10-15 seconds delay is normal as the VAD model loads.

---

#### Step 7: Customize (Optional)
- **Change LLM Model**: Modify `model="meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"` in the `NimLLMService` instantiation to another supported model.
- **Adjust Prompt**: Edit the `messages` content to change Lydia’s behavior or knowledge base.
- **Local NIM Microservices**: Replace the API endpoints with `base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1"` if running NIM locally.
